            Attires and ornaments speak volumes about the geographical, cultural and traditional peculiarities of a community. And, Ladakh is no different; the snow-capped mountains, treacherous terrains and cold deserts hint at freezing winters with temperatures often touching minus 30Â°C.The traditional livestock rearing has enabled people of Ladakh to protect themselves and their loved ones from harsh winters. The sheep, goats and yaks not only provide for their food but also clothing. People weave high quality thermals, shawls, caps and socks from the wool and pashmina produce. In fact, the woollen clothes and pashmina shawls of Ladakh are famed across the world for their uniqueness of warmth, suppleness and feel on the skin of the wearer.
